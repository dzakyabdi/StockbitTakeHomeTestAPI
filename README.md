API Automation Test Setup

üß∞ Tools & Applications Required
1. Java
   
Used as the primary programming language for developing automation test scripts.

2. Postman
   
I usually use it to test APIs using the required methods, parameters, and payloads before writing the automation code.

3. IntelliJ
   
Used as the code editor and for initializing the project using Maven.


üì¶ Dependencies (pom.xml)

The following dependencies are required for this project:
- io.rest-assured
- org.testng
- org.hamcrest
- jackson-databind
- jacksonschema-generator


‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Automation

1. Clone the repository
2. Resolve all dependencies (Maven will handle this automatically)
6. Run the automation tests through your IDE or using Maven/TestNG commands
